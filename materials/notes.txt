$\Gamma$ 函数的符号式勒让德引入的。
Dirichlet 把  beta 函数给推广到了 n 维情形。 由此可以推出 $n$ 维球体积

 As Bessel, Legendre and Gauss did, Kramp worked on the generalised factorial
 function which applied to non-integers. His work on factorials is independent
 of that of James Stirling and Vandermonde. He was the first to use the
 notation n! (Elements d'arithmétique universelle, 1808). In fact, the more
 general concept of factorial was found at the same time by Arbogast.

167 letters from the Euler-Goldbach Correspondence were published by P.H. Fuss
in his Correspondance math閙atique et physique de quelques c閘鑒res g閛m鑤res
du XVIII鑝e si鑓le . The letters below all came from Fuss' book. Unfortunately,
Fuss often excised the personal part of the correspondence, and published only
the scientific material. A complete set of the correspondence will have to wait
until the publication of the appropriate volume of the Opera Omnia

In Institutiones calculi integralis (1768-70) Euler made a thorough
investigation of integrals which can be expressed in terms of elementary
functions. He also studied beta and gamma functions, which he had introduced
first in 1729. Legendre called these 'Eulerian integrals of the first and
second kind' respectively while they were given the names beta function and
gamma function by Binet and Gauss respectively. As well as investigating double
integrals, Euler considered ordinary and partial differential equations in this
work.

Legendre's major work on elliptic functions in Exercices du Calcul Intégral
appeared in three volumes in 1811, 1817, and 1819. In the first volume Legendre
introduced basic properties of elliptic integrals and also of beta and gamma
functions. More results on beta and gamma functions appeared in the second
volume together with applications of his results to mechanics, the rotation of
the Earth, the attraction of ellipsoids and other problems. The third volume
was largely devoted to tables of elliptic integrals.

We mentioned above that he studied interpolation in the Methodus
Differentialis. For example he defined the series Tn+1 = nTn with T1 = 1. He
then considered T3/2, between the terms T1 and T2. In today's notation this
would be Γ(½) and Stirling here is studying the Gamma function. He calculated
T3/2 to ten decimal places. In fact

T3/2 = Γ(½) = √

The book contains other results on the Gamma function and the Hypergeometric
function.

De Moivre published Miscellanea Analytica in 1730. Stirling wrote to De Moivre
pointing out some errors that he had made in a table of logarithms of
factorials in the book and also telling De Moivre about Example 2 to
Proposition 28 of Methodus Differentialis. De Moivre was able to extend his
earlier results using Stirling's ideas and published a Supplement to
Miscellanea Analytica a few months later. Clearly Stirling and De Moivre
regularly corresponded around this time for in September 1730 Stirling relates
the episode and new results of De Moivre in a letter to Gabriel Cramer.

There is another area of Stirling's work that we shall examine, namely his work
on gravitation and the figure of the Earth. However, before doing so we will
look at a correspondence that Stirling had with Euler since this relates to the
work we have just discussed on series. Euler wrote to Stirling on 8 June 1736
from St Petersburg. We quote from his letter where he gives his opinion on
Stirling's work (see [7] or [3]):-
